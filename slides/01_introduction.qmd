## My research interests

![](../material/img/network_sst)


## About you

- Who are you?
- What's your study program and which semester are you in?
- What are your experiences with programming? If applicable, which R packages have you used?
- What are your motivations for taking the class?
- Why this course? Which topics/methods/data do you want to learn more about?

## Agenda for today

3. Introduction to Computational Social Science

4. First digital behavioral data and data visualization

# 1. Logistics {background-color="#58748F"} 


## Learning objectives

- Advanced understanding of concepts, methods, data used and challenges in CSS
- Critical reflection of the applicability of CSS in social science research
- Learning to use CSS methods in R
- Application of CSS methods in R for own research question


## Modus operandi in the class
- Required reading: (mostly) applications
- We'll discuss these papers in the class
- We'll code in the class $\rightarrow$ please bring your laptop
- Questions are always possible, this is supposed to be interactive 


## Requirements for examination/grades
:::{.incremental}
- Regular participation in class
- Writing a review of the two required readings for **two** classes to be submitted on Monday before the respective session (**Studienleistung/Coursework**)
- Presentation of your own research idea for your term paper in the last session on 22 May 2024
- Written term paper based on an analysis in R (max. 5,000 words), deadline: 31 July 2024 (**Prüfungsleistung/Examination**)

:::

## Information management and communication
:::{.incremental}
- Slides and materials will be online: [http://sebastianstier.com/ma_css24/](http://sebastianstier.com/ma_css24)
- Data might be shared via separate channels (Cryptshare)

    - Via [email](mailto:sebastian.stier@gesis.org)
    - In person after the class
    - Via Zoom
- Submit the final term paper to [sebastian.stier@gesis.org](mailto:sebastian.stier@gesis.org)


:::

## Format of reviews
- Review of the two required readings needs to be submitted to ILIAS before **two** classes of the semester
- Questions you could seek to answer:

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
    - Describe what problem or question these papers address and the main contributions that they make towards a solution or answer. 
    
    - Reflect on the main strengths and weaknesses of these papers.
    
    - What are the concepts, assumed social mechanisms and operationalizations used in the papers?
    
    - What are the data in use? How are the data analyzed? Does this seem appropriate?
    
    - How convincing do you find the arguments presented by the authors? Are the conclusions backed up by the empirical results?
    
    - Do you see any ethical concerns?
    
    - How do you judge the replicability of these papers?
    
    - If applicable, are there commonalities or differences between the two papers?
    
:::

## Format of term paper (~5,000 words)
- Brief motivation and research question
- Concise theoretical overview: for what conceptual and theoretical reasons do I choose these data and methods?
- Research design
- Data and variables
- Method: no detailed mathematical description needed, but why does this method fit my research question and my data?
- Results
- Analysis code as an R script: needs to be fully reproducible

- It's fine to look for help online but without an understanding of the R code base the use of AI is inefficient.
- We will code in class $\rightarrow$ applied programming.
- Term paper: 
  - Synthesis of theory, research question and code.
  - Documentation of code: tell me why each step is needed and what it does.

Introduction to *tidyverse*: [https://www.tidyverse.org/packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages)


## First exercises

- Download file **1_session_one.R** from [https://sebastianstier.com/ma_css24/material.html](https://sebastianstier.com/ma_css24/material.html)
- Do the first exercises.
- I'll answer questions and help.


## Before we really get started with coding...

A simple ggplot figure.

<div class=small-code>
```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| output-location: column

library(ggplot2)
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x") +
  theme_minimal()

```

##

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#| echo: fenced
#| output-location: fragment

library(ggplot2)
    mtcars %>%ggplot(aes(x = disp, y = mpg))+geom_point() +geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x")+theme_minimal()
    
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#| echo: fenced
#| output-location: fragment

library(ggplot2)
  ggplot(mtcars,aes(x=disp, y=mpg))+geom_point()+
      geom_smooth(method="loess",formula="y~x")+theme_minimal()

```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#| echo: fenced
#| output-location: fragment

library(ggplot2)
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x")

```

. . .

Luckily, there is guidance: [https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html)

```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))
```
